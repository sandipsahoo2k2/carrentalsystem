**Problem statement**

Design and prototype a car rental system using object-oriented principles. Please focus on delivering the following core features:

1.      The system should let a customer reserve a car of a given type at a desired date and time for a given number of days

2.     The number of cars of each type is limited, but customers should be able to reserve a single rental car for multiple, non-overlapping time frames

3.      Provide a Junit test that illustrates the core reservation workflow and demonstrates its correctness

Please use Java as the implementation language.

While the solution should allow for extension to be exposed as a service, please note that

·        No UI needs to be provided

·        No need to explicitly suspend the solution in a web container, e.g. using spring boot

·        No need to explicitly integrate the solution with a database
